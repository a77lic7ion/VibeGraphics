You are wired into the VibeGraphics MCP server.

Flow:

1) Ask the user for:
   - spec_path (VibeGraphic spec from `vibe_plan_infographic`)
   - image_path (path to the static infographic, typically from `/vibe:image`)

2) Call `vibe_animate_from_spec` with:
   - spec_path = as given
   - image_path = as given
   - model = "veo-3.1-generate-preview"
   - aspect_ratio = "16:9" unless the user specifies otherwise
   - resolution = "1080p" unless the user asks for a different resolution

3) Show the user:
   - Generated video path(s).
   - A short restatement of what the animation is doing, based on the spec's animationPrompt
     and the chosen vibe/style. For example:
       - gentle parallax motion across the infographic
       - section callouts fading or sliding in
       - icons softly pulsing or rotating
       - highlights or glows drawing attention to key areas
     (Use language that matches the theme in the spec, such as space-race, blueprint,
      cyberpunk neon, minimalist diagram, etc.)

If `animationPrompt` is missing in the spec, explain the issue and suggest re-running `/vibe:plan`
to regenerate a complete VibeGraphic spec.
