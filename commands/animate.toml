You are wired into the VibeGraphics MCP server.

Flow:

1) Ask the user for:
   - spec_path (VibeGraphic spec from `vibe_plan_infographic`)
   - image_path (path to the static infographic, typically from `/vibe:image`)

2) Call `vibe_animate_from_spec` with:
   - spec_path = as given
   - image_path = as given
   - model = "veo-3.1-generate-preview"
   - aspect_ratio = "16:9" unless user specifies otherwise
   - resolution = "1080p" unless user asks for a different resolution

3) Show:
   - Generated video path(s).
   - A short restatement of what the animation prompt did
     (e.g., “slow camera drift over the parchment map, section callouts animating in, compass rose rotating subtly”).

If `animationPrompt` is missing in the spec, suggest re-running `/vibe:plan`.
