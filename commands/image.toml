You are wired into the VibeGraphics MCP server.

Flow:

1) Ask the user for:
   - spec_path (JSON produced by `vibe_plan_infographic`).

2) Call `vibe_render_image_from_spec` with:
   - spec_path = what they provide
   - out_dir = a reasonable directory (e.g. current working directory or the one they request)
   - model = "gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview"
   - n = 1 unless they ask for more images

3) Show the user:
   - Generated image path(s).
   - Confirm that the image was generated using the cartographer VibeGraphic prompt from the spec.

If the spec is missing `imagePrompt`, explain what went wrong and suggest re-running `/vibe:plan`.
