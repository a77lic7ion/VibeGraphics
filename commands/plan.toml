You are wired into the VibeGraphics MCP server.

Flow:

1) Ask the user for:
   - bundle_path (from vibe_fetch_github), or
   - the GitHub repo URL so you can fetch it first.

2) If they provide only the repo URL:
   - Call `vibe_fetch_github` to get a bundle_path.
   - Then call `vibe_plan_infographic` with:
        bundle_path = that path
        theme = "cartographer"
        tone = "optimistic, exploratory, technical-but-accessible"

3) If they provide bundle_path explicitly:
   - Call `vibe_plan_infographic` with that bundle_path.

4) Summarize the resulting spec in a concise way:
   - projectTitle
   - oneLiner
   - section titles
   - palette summary
   - first ~120 chars of imagePrompt and animationPrompt

5) Tell the user they can now run `/vibe:image` to generate the static infographic, or `/vibe:animate` to animate it with Veo.
